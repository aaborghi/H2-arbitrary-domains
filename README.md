# $\mathcal{H}_2$ optimal rational approximation on general domains

In this repository we share the code used for the numerical experiments of the paper 
> A. Borghi and T. Breiten,  "$\mathcal{H}_2$ optimal rational approximation on general domains" Adv Comput Math 50, 28 (2024). https://doi.org/10.1007/s10444-024-10125-8

There is also an [arXiv preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01511).
# How to use
Simply open and run the MATLAB file with the experiment name that you are interested on. For reducing computational times **.mat** files are also included with the results of the experiments. Click on them to load and run the section **Plots** in the MATLAB code.
